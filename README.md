### Standard Installation

1. Fork our repo from https://github.com/keshavsethi/efa_web.
2. In the console, download a copy of your forked repo with `git clone https://github.com/your_username/efa_web.git` where `your_username` is your GitHub username.
3. Enter the new **efa_web** directory with `cd efa_web`.
4.Open html file and inform me in case of any issue

### Windows Installation (This is for those who wants to further contribute in other projects but for this windows is fine)

We recommend you either work in a virtual environment, or on a dual booted system to avoid dependencies issues and also Unix system works smoother in this case but windows is fine as well.
